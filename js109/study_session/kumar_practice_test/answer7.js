/*

The while condition assigns the global variable counter to 1.
(The while condition does not use a comparison operator
  such as <, >, or ===.)
Line 4 logs 1, and then line 5 increments counter to 2.
The if clause is false because 2 is not greater than 2,
and then the loop repeats with counter being reassigned
back to 1.
