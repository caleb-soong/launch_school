/*The function twice defines a single parameter num, a number, and coerces it to a string value.
Then, an array is created with each element being a single character of the string.
If there are an odd number of elements (digits), then the function returns twice the value of the original number passed in.
Otherwise, if there are an even number of elements, two strings are created, one with the first half of the elements of the array
and the other with the second half of the elements of the array. If the two strings are the same, then the function
returns the original number. Otherwise, the function returns twice the value of the original number.*/
