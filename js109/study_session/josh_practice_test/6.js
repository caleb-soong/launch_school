/*This code logs the number 34 to the console. The function is called on line 7, and the value of the global variable 'answer'
is passed in as the argument to the function. The parameter 'someNumber' is assigned to the value 42, and the function
returns the number 50 which is the value to which 'newAnswer' is assigned. However, the value of 'answer' is still 42
because primitive values are immutable and strings and primitive values.*/
