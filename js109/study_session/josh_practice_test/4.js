/*The code does not log anything to the console because the console.log method is never invoked.
The function scream defines a single parameter, and the function body uses the + operator with the first operand
being the parameter and the second argument being another string. Since the value of the argument passed in
to the function is a string argument, the + performs string concatenation, and a new string is returned.
But nothing is logged to the console.*/
