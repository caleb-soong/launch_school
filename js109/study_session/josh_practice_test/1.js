/*On line 1, a global variable with identifier 'num' is declared with the let keyword and initialized to the number 1.
A while loop is defined on lines 3-7 with a condition that the value of the global variable 'num' must be less than 3 for the loop to run.
Inside the loop on line 4, a new variable with the same identifer 'num' is declared with the let keyword and initialized to the number 5.
This is the variable that gets incremented on line 5, so its value becomes 6, and 6 is what is logged to the console on line 6.
The loop repeats infinitely because the condition again checks to see if the value of the global variable 'num' is less than 3, and it is
because nothing inside the loop is changing its value.
Line 9 never executes because the while loop never stops.*/
